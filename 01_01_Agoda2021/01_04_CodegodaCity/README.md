Codegoda City is preparing to welcome back international tourists. The city is full of attractions, many of which can be reached through several bi-directional connections. However, some attractions are connected through only one pathway. These one-path connections are called Goji Connections, and the local mayor is concerned that once tourism is open, these connections may produce large crowds that inhibit social distancing.

The mayor wants to expand these one-path connections to create more connections and safer tourism. However, Codegoda City has never mapped all the Goji Connections. Please help the local mayor to find all the Goji Connections so international travel to Codegoda City can start again!
